  "description": [
    "This CRUD was commissioned by a company whose objective is to analyze eye problems (searching for diabetic retinopathies) using AI and proprietary algorithms. My role was to develop the CRUD interface for two user roles: specialists and administrators. The former are responsible for diagnostics and improving the algorithm, while the latter manage users.",
    "The application includes a login for session initiation, and two main sections: a patient section to register new patients, and a user section where administrators can create, edit, update permissions, and delete users.",
    "The main technology used in this project was ReactJS. This choice was not mine, but rather a requirement from the client, who wanted to use a specific component suite—specifically <a href=\"https://mui.com/material-ui/\">Material UI</a>.",
    "In this project, I was subcontracted solely for the frontend implementation, so I did not work directly with the company receiving the application, but through a third party."
